# Election-Analysis
# Overview of Election Audit
For this project we took a large csv file that contained the election data for several Colorado counties, analyzed the election, and printed it to a txt file. The results included: the total number of votes cast, a list of the candidates who received votes, the total number of votes each candidate received, the percent of votes each candidate received, and finally we found the winner of the election based on popular votes.
# Election-Audit Results: 
 -How many votes were cast in this congressional election? 369,711
 
 -Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
